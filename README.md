### Hi there 👋 ### 

My name is Mario Vidal I live in Madrid, I am a web developer, trained to work as a full stack developer, I have worked on studio projects where I mainly implemented 

const techSkills = {

  JavaScript, 
  Node.js, 
  React.js, 
  Redux, 
  Bootstrap, 
  CSS,
  HTML5, 
  Express, 
  Sequelize
  PostgreSQL,
  React Native
  
};

using the Scrum methodology and teamwork with GIT-flow. 💻

I also worked for an Argentine company designing and leading a dedicated ERP (enterprise resource planning systems application) , based on Microsoft VBA, Excel and Microsoft Power Bi. 🖱️

I am interested in continuing to increase my technical skills to a high level, without limiting myself and using them to create innovative projects where I can lead development teams and meet the goal of providing a solution to some of the problems I see on a daily basis.

What am I currently doing? ⌨️

To continue training and looking for a place where I can grow and realize my dreams and goals as a develop, making a personal project and freelance tech supporting  🔧
